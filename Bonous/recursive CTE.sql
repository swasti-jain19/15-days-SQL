-- Create an employee hierarchy table and use a recursive CTE to find all subordinates of a given employee --

-- Create the employee table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (
    employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employee(employee_id)

-- Insert sample data to establish an employee hierarchy
INSERT INTO employee (employee_id, name, manager_id) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', NULL),       -- Alice is the CEO, no manager
(2, 'Bob', 1),            -- Bob reports to Alice
(3, 'Charlie', 1),        -- Charlie reports to Alice
(4, 'David', 2),          -- David reports to Bob
(5, 'Eve', 2),            -- Eve reports to Bob

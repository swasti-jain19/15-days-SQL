This guide outlines the steps to import data from an SQL file into a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin.

**1. Open pgAdmin**

* Launch pgAdmin on your system.

**2. Connect to your Server**

* In the left-hand pane, expand the "Servers" node.
* Click on the server you want to connect to.

**3. Select the Database**

* Expand the "Databases" node under your server.
* Select the specific database where you want to import the data.

**4. Open Query Tool**

* Right-click on the selected database and choose "Query Tool" from the context menu.

**5. Load the SQL File**

* In the Query Tool window, click on the "Open File" button (it usually looks like a folder icon).

**6. Execute the Query**

* Press F5 or click on the "Execute" button (the play button icon) to run the SQL commands in the file.
